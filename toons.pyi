class ToonDecodeError(ValueError):
    """Exception raised by the TOON decoder when input cannot be parsed.

    Subclasses ``ValueError`` for backward compatibility, so existing
    ``except ValueError`` handlers continue to catch parse failures.

    Attributes:
        line: 1-based line number where the error was detected, or ``None``
            if the location is unknown (e.g. empty input).
        source: The raw source line (including original indentation) where
            the error was detected, or ``None`` if unknown.

    The default message is formatted as ``"Line N: <detail>"`` when a line
    number is available, matching the canonical TypeScript reference
    implementation (``@toon-format/toon``).

    Example:
        >>> try:
        ...     toons.loads("items[3]: a,b")
        ... except toons.ToonDecodeError as exc:
        ...     print(exc.line, exc.source, str(exc))
